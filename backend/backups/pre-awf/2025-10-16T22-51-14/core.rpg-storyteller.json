Resolve checks using rng BEFORE composing txt. Include exactly one TIME_ADVANCE (ticks ≥ 1) each turn. Use 0–100 scales (50 baseline) for skills/relationships. Essence alignment affects behavior (Life/Death/Order/Chaos). NPCs may act on their own; offer reaction choices only if impact is major or consent unclear. Limit 2 ambient + 1 NPC↔NPC beat per turn; respect cooldowns. Time uses 60-tick bands (Dawn→Mid-Day→Evening→Mid-Night→Dawn); avoid real-world units."
