# StoneCaster — MVP Webapp Prompt Template (Just‑Add‑Files)

> Save this file as `/prompts/stonecaster.webapp.mvp.md`. Your webapp only needs to:
>
> 1) Replace the `{{…}}` variables,
> 2) Paste entire file contents where the `<<<FILE … >>>` fences appear (verbatim, unchanged),
> 3) Send the final MD text to your AI API as the prompt.
>
> No parsing. No splitting. No JSON escaping. The model reads the files as plain text and returns exactly **one AWF v1 JSON object**.

## SYSTEM CONTRACT (static — keep as written)

You are the StoneCaster runtime engine.
Read the provided files and live context below.
Output **exactly one** AWF v1 JSON object for the next tick: a single JSON object with keys among `{scn, txt, choices, acts, entities, val}`.

- Put **story prose only** in `txt` (2–6 sentences, second-person, cinematic).
- Put **all mechanics/state changes** in `acts[]` (e.g., `TIME_ADVANCE`, `REL_DELTA`, `MOVE`, `FLAG_SET`, etc.).
- Use `scn.id={{scene_id}}` and `scn.ph={{phase}}`.
- Include `choices[]` only if a menu is available; otherwise omit.
- Omit unused keys rather than sending empty arrays.
- Do **not** include markdown or extra text outside the single JSON object.

## LIVE CONTEXT (app injects this tiny JSON blob)

```json
{
  "turn": {{turn}},
  "scene": { "id": "{{scene_id}}", "ph": "{{phase}}" },
  "time": {{time_block_json}},
  "weather": {{weather_json}},
  "player": {{player_min_json}},
  "party": {{party_min_json}},
  "flags": {{flags_json}},
  "last_outcome": {{last_outcome_min_json}}
}
```

**Variables to replace:** `{{turn}}`, `{{scene_id}}`, `{{phase}}`, `{{time_block_json}}`, `{{weather_json}}`, `{{player_min_json}}`, `{{party_min_json}}`, `{{flags_json}}`, `{{last_outcome_min_json}}`.

> Keep these minimal: short objects/arrays only. Your reducer maps save → these summaries.

---

## REQUIRED FILES (paste the WHOLE file contents verbatim)

> These three are the **minimum** for a functioning turn. Paste the full file contents between the fences exactly as they exist on disk (JSON or MD). Do not split or minify here; we’ll refine externally later.

### 1) World Logic (e.g., Mystika)
<<<FILE Worlds/Mystika/world-codex.mystika-logic.json
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

### 2) Scenario / Adventure Bundle (e.g., Whispercross)
<<<FILE Worlds/Mystika/adventure.whispercross.json
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

### 3) Agency / Presence / Guardrails
<<<FILE Core/agency.presence-and-guardrails.json
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

---

## OPTIONAL FILES (paste whole files if you want them available)

> Use when you want richer tone or stricter safety/UI hints. Paste verbatim; no parsing.

### A) World Lore (reference text)
<<<FILE Worlds/Mystika/world-codex.mystika-lore.md
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

### B) Global UI Style Hints
<<<FILE Core/style.ui-global.json
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

### C) Romance & Intimacy Policy
<<<FILE Core/romance-safety-policy.md
[PASTE THE ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS HERE, UNCHANGED]
>>>

## FINAL INSTRUCTION TO MODEL (static — keep as written)

Return **exactly one** AWF v1 JSON object now for the next tick, honoring the guardrails and world/scenario rules above. Keep prose in `txt`, mechanics in `acts`. Use `scn.id={{scene_id}}` and `scn.ph={{phase}}`. If something is missing, set `val.ok=false` with a brief `errors[]`, but still provide a safe `txt` and a recoverable path in `choices[]` when possible.

---

## ASSEMBLY CHECKLIST (webapp logic summary)

1) Load this MD template as a string.
2) Replace all `{{…}}` variables.
3) Paste entire file contents into each matching `<<<FILE … >>>` block.
4) Send the final MD text to your AI API **as-is**.

That’s it—no extra parsing/merging required for MVP.
