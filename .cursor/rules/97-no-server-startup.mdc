# No Server Startup Rule

**CRITICAL**: Never start development servers (frontend or backend) in this project.

## Prohibited Commands
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev:server`
- `npm run dev:client` 
- `npm run dev:parallel`
- `npm run dev:local`
- `npm start`
- `node dist/index.js`
- Any command that starts a server on ports 3000, 5173, 5174, 5175

## Allowed Commands
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter
- `npm run seed:data` - Seed database
- `npm run validate:docs` - Validate documents
- Any script that doesn't start a server

## Rationale
- Servers consume resources and can interfere with other development
- Focus on code changes, builds, and tests instead
- Database operations and validation can be done without servers
- Prevents accidental long-running processes

## Enforcement
If a server is accidentally started:
1. Immediately kill it with `npx kill-port 3000 5173 5174 5175`
2. Acknowledge the mistake
3. Continue with non-server tasks only

**This rule cannot be broken under any circumstances.**
