# React Frontend Rules

- Use shadcn/ui + Tailwind; design for 375Ã—812 first.
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod; label every input; aria-describedby for errors.
- State: local UI state in components; server state via React Query hooks.
- Navigation: mobile hamburger + Drawer for authed routes; keep persistent sidebar at md+.
- Performance: avoid heavy imports in hot paths; memoize noisy components.
