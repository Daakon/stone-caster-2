# No NPM Run Commands Rule

## Overview
This rule prevents Cursor from executing `npm run` commands directly. All operations must use package.json scripts through the appropriate package manager (pnpm, npm, yarn) but never through direct `npm run` execution.

## Prohibited Commands
- `npm run <script>`
- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm build`
- `npm dev`
- Any direct npm script execution

## Allowed Alternatives
- Use `pnpm <script>` (preferred for this project)
- Use `npm <script>` (without the `run` keyword)
- Use `yarn <script>`
- Use package.json script names directly with the package manager

## Rationale
- Ensures consistent package manager usage across the project
- Prevents accidental execution of scripts in wrong environments
- Maintains proper dependency resolution and lock file consistency
- Aligns with project's pnpm-first approach

## Enforcement
- All AI agents must use the appropriate package manager directly
- Script execution should go through the package manager's native interface
- When suggesting commands, always use the full package manager command

## Examples

### ❌ Prohibited
```bash
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run build
```

### ✅ Allowed
```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm test
pnpm build
npm dev
npm test
npm build
yarn dev
yarn test
yarn build
```

## Scope
- All terminal commands
- All script execution
- All development workflows
- All CI/CD operations
