# Headless Testing Only Rule

## CRITICAL: All tests must run headless and non-interactively

### Mandatory Requirements:
- **Playwright**: Always set `headless: true` in config
- **Environment**: Set `PWDEBUG=0` to prevent debug mode
- **Reporter**: Use `--reporter=list` for CI/non-interactive runs
- **Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts to prevent hanging
- **No UI**: Never use `--ui`, `--headed`, or `--debug` flags

### Commands that MUST be used:
```bash
# E2E Tests
PWDEBUG=0 playwright test --reporter=list

# Unit Tests  
CI=1 vitest run --coverage --passWithNoTests

# Never use:
# playwright test --ui
# playwright test --headed  
# playwright test --debug
# vitest (without run flag)
```

### Configuration Requirements:
- Playwright config must have `headless: true`
- Set `actionTimeout` and `navigationTimeout`
- Use `reporter: 'list'` for CI environments
- Never open browsers or interactive tools

### Violation Consequences:
- Tests that hang or open browsers are considered failures
- Must be fixed immediately before continuing development
- This rule applies to ALL testing scenarios

### Rationale:
- Prevents hanging in CI/CD environments
- Ensures tests can run in headless servers
- Maintains consistent testing behavior
- Prevents user intervention requirements
