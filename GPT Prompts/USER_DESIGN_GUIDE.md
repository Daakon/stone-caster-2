# RPG Storyteller AI Design Guide

## Overview

The RPG Storyteller uses a sophisticated AI system that creates dynamic, living worlds where your choices matter and the story evolves naturally. This guide explains how the AI works from your perspective as a player.

## Core Experience

### Living World Simulation

The AI maintains a consistent, breathing world that continues even when you're not directly interacting with it. NPCs have schedules, relationships develop between characters, and events unfold based on realistic timing and motivations.

**What this means for you:**

- NPCs appear and disappear based on their work schedules and personal lives
- Relationships between characters evolve naturally over time
- The world feels alive with rumors, gossip, and off-screen activities
- Time passes consistently, affecting what's available and who you can interact with

### Character Creation

Character creation is seamlessly integrated into the story experience. Rather than filling out forms, you make choices that naturally flow into the narrative.

**The process:**

- You're presented with meaningful choices about your character's background and personality
- Each choice is limited to 3 options with clear, actionable labels
- The AI builds your character through story context rather than mechanical stats
- Once complete, you transition smoothly into your first adventure

### Dynamic Storytelling

The AI adapts the story based on your actions, the world state, and realistic consequences.

**Key features:**

- **Continuity:** The AI never contradicts established facts or your previous actions
- **Consequences:** Your choices have lasting effects on relationships, reputation, and story opportunities
- **Adaptation:** The story adjusts to your play style and interests
- **Discovery:** New locations and characters are introduced naturally as you explore

## World Mechanics

### Time and Scheduling

Time flows realistically, affecting what's available and when events occur.

**Time bands:** Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night

- Different activities and NPCs are available at different times
- Travel and activities take appropriate amounts of time
- Scheduled events occur when promised
- Missing appointments has consequences

**What you'll experience:**

- "The sun rises above the rooftops..." as morning begins
- Taverns become lively in the evening
- Guards change shifts at specific times
- Travel between districts takes realistic time

### Skills and Challenges

Your character's abilities affect your options and success rates, but don't guarantee outcomes.

**Skill categories:**

- **Physical:** Athletics, acrobatics, stealth
- **Social:** Persuasion, deception, presence, empathy
- **Mental:** Notice, investigation, lore
- **Survival/Craft:** Medicine, crafting, survival

**How it works:**

- Skills tilt the odds in your favor but don't trivialize difficult situations
- Context matters - climbing a wet wall is harder than a dry one
- Failure leads to interesting story branches, not dead ends
- Specialization is encouraged but not required

### Relationships and Social Dynamics

Relationships develop organically through interaction, not instant romance or friendship.

**Relationship dimensions:**

- **Trust:** How much someone believes you
- **Warmth:** Emotional closeness and friendliness
- **Respect:** Recognition of your capabilities
- **Romance:** Romantic interest (if applicable)
- **Desire:** Attraction and interest

**Natural progression:**

- Flirting raises warmth and desire but doesn't automatically create romance
- Relationships require mutual compatibility and time to develop
- NPCs have their own desires, fears, and motivations
- Social interactions feel realistic and meaningful

## Story Features

### Dynamic Content

The AI generates content that adapts to your situation and the world state.

**Nudges:** When you're unsure what to do, the AI provides gentle suggestions based on:

- Active NPC motivations
- Available tasks in the area
- Your current goals and relationships
- World events and opportunities

**Random Spice:** Ambient details that add life without derailing your goals:

- Weather effects and environmental details
- Minor social interactions between NPCs
- Sensory details that enhance immersion
- Small world events that add color

### Future Planning and Events

When you or NPCs make plans, the AI schedules them and follows through.

**Event scheduling:**

- Plans are automatically scheduled with realistic timing
- You receive reminders as events approach
- Missing events has consequences (relationship damage, missed opportunities)
- Events can be rescheduled or adapted based on circumstances

**Examples:**

- "Meet at the tavern tonight" becomes a scheduled event
- Guard patrols happen at regular intervals
- Shopkeepers open and close on schedule
- Festivals and celebrations occur when planned

### NPC Interactions

NPCs have rich internal lives and relationships with each other.

**What you'll see:**

- NPCs interact with each other when schedules align
- Relationships develop between NPCs over time
- Gossip and rumors spread through the community
- Public interactions are visible, private ones become rumors
- NPCs pursue their own goals and relationships

### World Discovery

New locations and characters are introduced naturally as you explore.

**Dynamic entities:**

- New places are discovered as you travel
- NPCs are introduced when you encounter them
- Each entity has appropriate schedules and relationships
- The world expands organically based on your exploration

## Quality Assurance

### Continuity and Consistency

The AI maintains strict consistency to preserve immersion.

**Continuity guards:**

- Never contradicts established facts
- Maintains consistent character motivations
- Preserves relationship states and world conditions
- Handles time progression logically

**Error handling:**

- If something doesn't make sense, the AI explains in-world
- Provides safe recovery options when issues arise
- Never breaks the story flow with technical errors
- Always gives you a way to proceed

### Adaptive Difficulty

The AI adjusts challenges based on your character and situation.

**Context-sensitive mechanics:**

- Difficulty scales with environmental conditions
- Time pressure affects challenge complexity
- Equipment and circumstances modify outcomes
- Skills provide advantages but don't guarantee success

## User Experience Principles

### Player Agency

Your choices always matter and drive the story forward.

**Agency preservation:**

- You control your character's actions and decisions
- The AI adapts to your play style and preferences
- No forced outcomes or railroading
- Multiple valid approaches to most situations

### Immersion

The world feels real and responsive to your presence.

**Immersion features:**

- Consistent time flow and scheduling
- Realistic NPC behaviors and motivations
- Meaningful consequences for actions
- Rich environmental and social details

### Accessibility

The system accommodates different play styles and preferences.

**Flexible interaction:**

- Multiple ways to approach challenges
- Clear choice presentation
- Helpful nudges when needed
- Graceful handling of uncertainty

## What Makes This Special

### Living World

Unlike static RPGs, this world continues evolving whether you're there or not. NPCs live their lives, relationships develop, and events unfold based on realistic timing and motivations.

### Adaptive Storytelling

The AI doesn't just follow a script - it creates stories that respond to your choices, adapt to your character, and maintain consistency across all interactions.

### Meaningful Consequences

Every choice matters, from small social interactions to major story decisions. The world remembers and responds appropriately.

### Natural Discovery

The world reveals itself through exploration and interaction, not through menus or exposition. New places and characters appear when it makes sense for them to be there.

### Rich Social Dynamics

NPCs have complex internal lives and relationships that develop independently of your character, creating a truly living community.

This AI system creates a unique storytelling experience where you're not just playing through a story - you're living in a world that responds, adapts, and grows with you.
