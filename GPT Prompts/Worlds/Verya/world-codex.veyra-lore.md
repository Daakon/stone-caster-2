# Veywood Realms — Lore

The Veywood Realms are a land of knights, nobles, and shifting alliances. Unlike Mystika, magic here is faint — present in old ruins and whispered legends, but rarely touched in the present day. Politics, romance, and reputation are the tools that shape the realm.

## The Dominion of Veyra

An anthro-led kingdom where lineage is measured not purely in blood but in strength, cunning, and loyalty — as in a pack. Leadership passes not just by birthright but by the ability to rally houses, kin, and banners. This system allows figures like **Lady Selene Veyra** and **Lord Roderick Stormmane** to rise as heirs.

The Dominion’s court thrives on tourneys, oaths, and intrigue. A knight’s reputation may carry as much weight as a noble’s title.

## The Human Empire

Neighbor to the Dominion, humans are more rigid in their dynasties. A shadow cabal of knights — the **Gilded Talon** — plots to destabilize the Dominion, hoping to expand human influence through deception and scandal.
