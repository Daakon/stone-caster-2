# Player‑Facing Design Doc (vNext) — RPG Storyteller

> This document explains how the game feels and behaves from a **player’s point of view**. It focuses on what you can expect on screen and in the story—no technical details.

---

## 1) What the Experience Feels Like

- You read a short piece of story, then choose what to do next.
- Consequences appear **before** new choices. The story never hides what your last choice did.
- Every turn moves time forward, even a little. Day and night actually matter.

---

## 2) Starting a New Adventure

- Character creation is quick and clear: a short intro and a small set of choices to define who you are.
- When you begin, the game quietly establishes a proper starting state so things like inventory, allies, and location make sense without you doing setup.

---

## 3) Time & Pacing You Can Feel

- **Time always passes.** Even a brief exchange costs a minute or two; long tasks can take much longer.
- **Day/Night:** Scenes change tone and availability as morning turns to afternoon, evening, and night. The world reacts to the hour.
- **Observation:** If you choose to wait or watch, you’ll get small details, minor discoveries, and gentle nudges—without dragging on.
- **Travel:** Moving across town offers light conversation or events on the way, or you can skip ahead. Either way, time advances and the world moves.
- **“Time flies” moments:** Parties, lively conversations, or flow state activities can jump the clock while staying concise on the page.

---

## 4) Choices, Direction, and Momentum

- You always have at least one meaningful choice. If things are quiet, the game offers **1–2 helpful suggestions** that fit the scene (not orders, just leads).
- Small, flavorful moments may happen occasionally—music in a tavern, a rumor, a passing patrol—to keep scenes alive without derailing your goal.

---

## 5) People & Relationships (18+ worlds)

- **Realistic attraction and attachment.** Flirting may warm someone to you, but deep romance isn’t automatic. Long‑term paths depend on compatibility and shared moments.
- **Casual vs. committed.** Some characters allow casual encounters even if they’re not a match for long‑term commitment. The story treats both respectfully.
- **NPCs relate to each other too.** You may witness (or hear rumors about) friendships, rivalries, or romances between non‑player characters. These can affect politics, access, and opportunities.
- **Consent and boundaries are respected.** Orientation, stated limits, and context matter. There are no minors.

---

## 6) Places, Discovery, and Who’s Where

- New locations and people can appear naturally in the story. When the game mentions a place or character, they also exist in the world from then on.
- People follow sensible routines: the barkeep is usually at the tavern in the evening; guards change posts with the hour. If you return later, the cast may have shifted.

---

## 7) Skills & Difficulty (How Challenge Feels)

- Your character is good at a **few** things, decent at some, and merely passable at the rest. You can’t be amazing at everything.
- Difficulty comes from context: rain on a roof, a crowded market, a wary adversary. Expertise helps, but hard tasks remain hard.
- Success isn’t binary. Sometimes you succeed cleanly; sometimes you get part of what you wanted with consequences; sometimes you fail and the story branches.

---

## 8) Appointments, Meetings, and Deadlines

- When you or an NPC talk about a future plan (a parley, a duel, a festival), the game schedules it.
- You’ll get subtle reminders as the time nears. If you miss it, the world reacts—someone is disappointed, a rumor spreads, a door closes—or the event happens without you.
- Truly critical events tend to arrange themselves even if you linger; people will leave to make them on time.

---

## 9) Off‑Screen Life (the World Moves)

- While you act, other characters pursue their own aims. Between scenes, routines update, relationships evolve, and factions nudge forward.
- You might catch the results directly (a changed guard roster) or indirectly (a whisper, a posted notice, a friend’s mood).

---

## 10) Continuity & Memory

- The story remembers what you’ve done: items used, promises kept, names learned, friendships started, wounds taken.
- It avoids contradictions. If something would break continuity, the game steers to an in‑world alternative instead of pretending it never happened.

---

## 11) Readability & Comfort

- Scene text is concise—enough detail to imagine clearly without becoming a wall of prose.
- Choice labels are short, scannable, and sometimes include small icons for flavor.
- Numbers and dice stay out of the way by default; curious players can opt into more transparency via the app’s UI.

---

## 12) Safety & Boundaries (Adult Scope)

- These worlds are written for adults. Even so, the tone aims for grounded, character‑driven intimacy rather than shock.
- Consent, orientation, and stated limits are treated as real constraints. Cruelty is never glamorized.

---

## 13) Errors, Edge Cases, and Graceful Recovery

- If something goes wrong (a scene is missing, a setup doesn’t fit), the story offers a graceful fallback and a way to continue.
- You’ll never be trapped with no choice. The game favors safe, in‑character pivots over breaking immersion.

---

## 14) Saves & Sessions

- A baseline save is created automatically when your adventure begins.
- The game records progress every turn. Short sessions still feel meaningful, and you can step away without losing the thread.

---

## 15) What You Can Expect Every Turn

1. A short, clear outcome to your last choice.
2. A subtle sense of passing time.
3. A stable set of new choices that fit the scene.
4. Occasional, restrained color—nudges or ambient life—when helpful.

---

## 16) What’s Out of Scope

- Rules manuals, dice math, or spreadsheets on screen.
- Endless small talk without pressure from the world.
- Guaranteed success. The story makes room for risk, change, and imperfect outcomes.

---

## 17) Promise of the Experience

You are not wrestling a rules engine—you’re living a story in a world that **breathes**: time passes, people have their own wants, plans are made and kept (or missed), and your choices shape what becomes possible next.

---

## 18) Inventory & Items

- You can **inspect**, **equip/use**, and **offer** items to others. The story clearly reflects gains and losses—no spreadsheets required.
- Items matter for fiction first: a keepsake may sway a friend; a torch changes how a ruin feels.
- Gifts aren’t magic keys. If an item fits someone’s tastes or needs, it helps; if not, they may refuse or react in-character.

## 19) Shops & Barter

- Merchants appear naturally where they make sense (markets, caravans, taverns at night).
- Buying and selling uses simple, readable choices; rare gear is found through story, favors, or reputation—not grind.
- Haggling and favors can matter, but they stay concise; time still advances while you browse.

## 20) Rest & Recovery

- **Short rests** (minutes) steady nerves, patch scrapes, and move the clock a little.
- **Long rests** (hours) heal more deeply and advance to the next meaningful time of day.
- Resting can trigger nighttime beats, rumors, or consequences if you choose risky places to sleep.

## 21) Map & Navigation Cues

- Directions are **diegetic**: locals, signboards, landmarks in the prose.
- For longer trips, you can **engage en route** (talk/events) or **skip ahead**; either way, time passes and the world moves.
- Once you’ve established safe routes, the game may offer faster travel options.

## 22) Objectives & Journal

- A light **Goals** list keeps track of what matters now (e.g., “Find proof for the wardens”).
- A short **“Last time…”** recap appears when you return from a break.
- Important appointments are scheduled for you; reminders surface naturally as the time nears.

## 23) Onboarding & Hints

- Early play includes gentle, in-character tips. You can adjust hint intensity from subtle to off.
- Definitions or reminders (names, places, factions) are available on demand without breaking immersion.

## 24) Mechanics Transparency

- By default, the story doesn’t show numbers. If you like, you can enable **Show Checks** in the UI to see rolls or difficulty hints.
- Transparency never changes outcomes—it only reveals more about how they were decided.

## 25) Endings & Replays

- Major arcs can resolve in different ways. Epilogues reflect your relationships, missed meetings, and the state of factions.
- Key **milestones** unlock quick replays from those points so you can explore alternate choices without restarting everything.

## 26) Accessibility & Comfort

- Adjustable text size and density; clear icon cues; high-contrast mode.
- Optional content warnings before heavy scenes (still fully 18+), with the choice to proceed.
- Quiet mode reduces ambient interruptions; you can focus on choices and outcomes.

## 27) Trimmable Features (scope control without breaking the experience)

- **Haggling depth** (can be simplified or removed; core buying still works).
- **Crafting detail** (can be minimized to simple success/fail beats).
- **Random “spice” frequency** (can be lowered for a calmer tone).
- **NPC↔NPC rumor surfacing** (can be limited to rare moments).
- **Fast travel prompts** (can be hidden; travel remains available via skip-ahead).
- **Journal pins & hint overlay** (can be turned off; goals and story still flow).
