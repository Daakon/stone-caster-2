## 2. User Experience Alignment ✅ EXCELLENT

### Perfect Alignment with Player Design Guide:

#### ✅ Time & Pacing

- **Mandatory time advancement** (≥1 minute per turn)
- **Band transitions** (morning/afternoon/evening/night) with in-world cues
- **Context-sensitive timing** (dialog: 1-5m, tasks: 10-45m, travel: 15-120m)
- **"Time flies" moments** for immersive activities

#### ✅ Living World Features

- **Off-screen world simulation** with schedule resolution
- **NPC↔NPC interactions** (≤2-3 per turn, budgeted)
- **World trickles** (faction changes, gossip spread)
- **Dynamic entity declaration** with persistence rules

#### ✅ Relationship System

- **Multi-dimensional bonds** (trust, warmth, respect, romance, desire)
- **Natural progression** (no instant romance, compatibility calculations)
- **NPC internal desires** (romance, desire, ambition, fear, curiosity)
- **Hysteresis & cooldowns** prevent ping-pong behavior

#### ✅ Skills & Difficulty

- **Context-sensitive mechanics** with environmental factors
- **Specialization limits** (≤3 skills at rank ≥4, ≤5 at rank ≥3)
- **DC scaling** (Trivial 8 to Heroic 23) with adjustment factors
- **Tick coupling** for realistic time investment

- **NPC state validation** with minimum detail requirements
- **Relationship range enforcement** (-3 to +3 with clamping)
- **Hard error detection** for invalid actor states

### Performance & Scalability:

- **Deterministic seeding** for reproducible random elements
- **Budgeted interactions** prevent system overload
- **Efficient entity management** with minimal schemas
- **Phase locks** prevent infinite loops
