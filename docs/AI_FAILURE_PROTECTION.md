# AI Failure Protection Implementation

## Problem
Users were being charged casting stones and having turns incremented even when AI responses failed validation (empty narratives, improper JSON format, etc.). This was unfair to users who received invalid responses.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive failure protection to ensure users are never charged for invalid AI responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. AI Service Error Handling (`backend/src/services/ai.ts`)

**Before**: AI service caught errors and returned fallback responses, which were then processed as valid turns.

**After**: AI service throws errors for any failure, preventing invalid responses from being processed.

```typescript
// Before: Returned fallback response
return {
  response: JSON.stringify(fallbackResponse),
  debug: includeDebug ? fallbackResponse.debug : undefined
};

// After: Throws error to prevent charging user
throw new Error(`AI service failed: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}`);
```

### 2. Enhanced Response Validation (`backend/src/services/ai.ts`)

Added comprehensive validation checks for AI responses:

- **JSON Structure**: Ensures response is a valid JSON object
- **Narrative Validation**: Checks for empty or invalid narratives
- **Minimum Length**: Prevents very short responses (< 10 characters)
- **Required Fields**: Validates presence of required fields like scene

```typescript
// Validate critical response fields
if (!parsed || typeof parsed !== 'object') {
  throw new Error('AI response is not a valid JSON object');
}

if (!parsed.txt || typeof parsed.txt !== 'string' || parsed.txt.trim().length === 0) {
  throw new Error('AI response has empty or invalid narrative');
}

if (parsed.txt.trim().length < 10) {
  throw new Error('AI response narrative is too short');
}
```

### 3. Turns Service Validation (`backend/src/services/turns.service.ts`)

Added additional validation checks before schema validation:

- **Narrative Content**: Ensures narrative is not empty or invalid
- **Minimum Length**: Prevents very short narratives
- **Early Failure**: Returns failure response before any processing

```typescript
// Additional validation checks before schema validation
if (!transformedResponse.narrative || typeof transformedResponse.narrative !== 'string' || transformedResponse.narrative.trim().length === 0) {
  console.error('[TURNS_SERVICE] AI response has empty or invalid narrative');
  return {
    success: false,
    error: ApiErrorCode.VALIDATION_FAILED,
    message: 'AI response has empty or invalid narrative',
    // ... detailed error information
  };
}
```

## Protection Flow

1. **AI Service Level**: Validates response structure and content
2. **Turns Service Level**: Additional validation before processing
3. **Schema Validation**: Final validation using Zod schemas
4. **Stone Deduction**: Only happens after ALL validations pass
5. **Turn Increment**: Only happens after successful turn processing

## User Protection

- ✅ **No Stone Deduction**: Users are not charged for failed AI responses
- ✅ **No Turn Increment**: Turn count is not incremented for failures
- ✅ **No Game State Changes**: Game state remains unchanged for failures
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Users receive clear feedback about what went wrong
- ✅ **Debug Information**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Error Handling

### AI Service Failures
- Invalid JSON responses
- Empty or missing narratives
- Missing required fields
- API call failures
- Response parsing errors

### Turns Service Failures
- Schema validation failures
- Narrative content issues
- Transformation errors
- Any other validation failures

## Logging

Enhanced logging provides clear information about failures:

```
[AI_SERVICE] CRITICAL: AI service failed - not charging user for failed response
[TURNS_SERVICE] AI response has empty or invalid narrative
[TURNS_SERVICE] AI response narrative is too short
```

## Testing

The system now properly handles:
- Empty AI responses
- Malformed JSON responses
- Responses with missing fields
- Very short narratives
- API call failures
- Any other validation failures

## Result

Users are now fully protected from being charged for invalid AI responses. The system only processes and charges for valid, high-quality AI responses that meet all validation criteria.
