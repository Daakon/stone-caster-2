# Gaps and Risks Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies missing invariants, brittle joins, performance hotspots, and token/cost risks in the current entry point system.

## Missing Invariants

### 1. Data Consistency Issues
**Problem**: No enforcement of referential integrity across entry point types
- Scenarios can reference non-existent adventures
- Adventures can reference non-existent worlds
- No validation of world_ref consistency

**Risk**: Data corruption, broken game states
**Impact**: High - Could cause game crashes or invalid states

### 2. Version Synchronization
**Problem**: No enforcement of version compatibility
- Scenarios can reference outdated adventure versions
- Adventures can reference outdated world versions
- No migration path for version updates

**Risk**: Runtime errors, inconsistent game behavior
**Impact**: High - Could cause prompt assembly failures

### 3. Content Validation
**Problem**: Limited validation of document content
- No validation of required fields in JSONB documents

- No validation of i18n completeness

**Risk**: Incomplete or malformed content
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause display issues or missing content

## Brittle Joins

### 1. Cross-Table Dependencies
**Problem**: Complex joins across multiple tables
- Scenarios → Adventures → Worlds
- Games → Adventures → Characters
- Prompts → Worlds → Adventures

**Risk**: Query failures, performance degradation
**Impact**: High - Could cause API failures

### 2. JSONB Field Access
**Problem**: Reliance on JSONB field extraction
- `scenarios.doc->>'world_ref'`
- `adventures.doc->>'name'`
- `worlds.doc->>'description'`

**Risk**: Field access failures, type mismatches
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause runtime errors

### 3. Dynamic Schema Dependencies
**Problem**: Schema changes break existing queries
- Adding new fields to JSONB documents
- Changing field names
- Modifying document structure

**Risk**: Breaking changes, data loss
**Impact**: High - Could cause system-wide failures

## Performance Hotspots

### 1. Database Query Performance
**Problem**: Inefficient queries across large datasets

### 2. Injection Vulnerabilities
**Problem**: Potential for injection attacks

**Risk**: System compromise, data corruption
**Impact**: High - Could cause security breaches

### 3. Access Control Gaps
**Problem**: Inconsistent access control
- Different RLS policies across tables
- No field-level permissions
- No audit logging for sensitive operations

**Risk**: Unauthorized access, data leaks
**Impact**: High - Could cause security violations

## Operational Risks

### 1. Deployment Complexity
**Problem**: Complex deployment with multiple systems
- Database migrations for multiple tables
- Frontend updates for multiple components
- API versioning across multiple endpoints

**Risk**: Deployment failures, system downtime
**Impact**: High - Could cause service outages

### 2. Monitoring Gaps
**Problem**: Limited monitoring and alerting
- No monitoring of prompt assembly performance
- No alerting on token usage
- No monitoring of database query performance

**Risk**: Undetected issues, system failures
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause delayed issue detection

### 3. Backup and Recovery
**Problem**: Complex backup and recovery requirements
- Multiple database tables to backup
- JSONB document consistency
- Cross-table data integrity

**Risk**: Data loss, recovery failures
**Impact**: High - Could cause data loss

## Scalability Risks

### 1. Database Scalability
**Problem**: Database performance under load
- Single database for all entry points
